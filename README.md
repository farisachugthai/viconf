# README

The product of me enjoying Vim a TINY bit too much.

After going through as much documentation as I could, this is the {still work-in-progress} collection of initializaiton files I use to run neovim and vim on Linux, Windows 10, and [Termux](github.com/termux/termuxapp).

As a result of personal modifications, this setup currently has:

- Autocompletion in any filetype
- Snippet integration/expansion
- Git integration with aliases
- Lightly configured embedded terminal
- Seamless tmux integration
- Asynchnours linters that are configured in my [dotfiles](github.com/farisachugthai/dotfiles)
- Syntax highlighting for files from Zim wiki
- Spell-checking with dictionaries that have been personally compiled and reviewed
- Multiple colorschemes that support xterm256 or 24 bits.
- Bundled fonts {wait is that true?}

## TODO

A shockingly large amount for how expansive this has already become.

- Modify syntax highlighting of markdown files. Underscores are in the SpellBad highlight group.
- Review snippets and effectively use them while learning new languages

On the horizon, a 'nice to have' would be workspace/project integration.

In addition, a more cleanly embedded IPython terminal would be phenomenal.
An active Jupyter kernel and a notebook would be great

TODO:
Add a screenshot section. Definitely one from Termux.

Without the incredible work from these diverse teams, I wouldn't have the best
text editor there is!

Thank you to the authors of the plugins:

I want to individually thank @tpope and @junegunn {is that weird?}.
