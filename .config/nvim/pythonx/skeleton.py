:Description:

Here is an appropriate place to give more detail for the module.
This module is a template for a python file that adheres to Google style
docstrings.

Section breaks are created by resuming unindented text. Section breaks
are also implicitly created anytime a new section starts.

Depends:
    requests
    other 3rd party modules

Example:
    Before you use the double colon to indicate a code block, give a quick
    synopsis of what the reader is seeing. Use rst formatting.::

        >>> hopefully_functional_code()
        >>> print("Ensure you leave one space above and below."
                  "Don't leave any spaces between lines if you print output.")

Attributes:

    module_level_variable1 (type): Explanation and give an inline docstring:

        Module level variables may be documented in
        either the ``Attributes`` section of the module docstring, or in an
        inline docstring immediately following the variable.

        Either form is acceptable, but the two should not be mixed. Choose
        one convention to document module level variables and be consistent
        with it.

.. todo::

    * For mod TODOs
    * The ``sphinx.ext.todo`` extension is required.
    * Mod functions come before classes so reorganize.

Around here would be an appropriate place to put:

"""

import numpy as np  # separate library and 3rd party modules

import vim_setup  # your own stuff comes last

module_level_variable2 = 98765
"""int: Module level variable documented inline.

The docstring may span multiple lines. The type may optionally be specified
on the first line, separated by a colon.

# TODO: Where did I get this?
class MainClass1(object):
    """This class docstring shows how to use sphinx and rst syntax.

    The first line is a brief explanation, which may be completed with
    a longer one. For instance to discuss about its methods. The only
    method here is :func:`function1`'s. The main idea is to document
    the class and methods's arguments with

    - **parameters**, **types**, **return** and **return types**::

          :param arg1: description
          :param arg2: description
          :type arg1: type description
          :type arg1: type description
          :return: return description
          :rtype: the return type description

    - and to provide sections such as **Example** using the double commas syntax::

          :Example:

          followed by a blank line !

      which appears as follow:

      :Example:

      followed by a blank line

    - Finally special sections such as **See Also**, **Warnings**, **Notes**
      use the sphinx syntax (*paragraph directives*)::

          .. seealso:: blabla
          .. warnings also:: blabla
          .. note:: blabla
          .. todo:: blabla

    .. note::
        There are many other Info fields but they may be redundant:
            * param, parameter, arg, argument, key, keyword: Description of a
              parameter.
            * type: Type of a parameter.
            * raises, raise, except, exception: That (and when) a specific
              exception is raised.
            * var, ivar, cvar: Description of a variable.
            * returns, return: Description of the return value.
            * rtype: Return type.

    .. note::
        There are many other directives such as versionadded, versionchanged,
        rubric, centered, ... See the sphinx documentation for more details.

    Here below is the results of the :func:`function1` docstring.

    """

    def function1(self, arg1, arg2, arg3):
        """returns (arg1 / arg2) + arg3

        This is a longer explanation, which may include math with latex syntax
        :math:`\\alpha`.
        Then, you need to provide optional subsection in this order (just to be
        consistent and have a uniform documentation. Nothing prevent you to
        switch the order):

          - parameters using ``:param <name>: <description>``
          - type of the parameters ``:type <name>: <description>``
          - returns using ``:returns: <description>``
          - examples (doctest)
          - seealso using ``.. seealso:: text``
          - notes using ``.. note:: text``
          - warning using ``.. warning:: text``
          - todo ``.. todo:: text``

        **Advantages**:
         - Uses sphinx markups, which will certainly be improved in future
           version
         - Nice HTML output with the See Also, Note, Warnings directives


        **Drawbacks**:
         - Just looking at the docstring, the parameter, type and  return
           sections do not appear nicely

        :param arg1: the first value
        :param arg2: the first value
        :param arg3: the first value
        :type arg1: int, float,...
        :type arg2: int, float,...
        :type arg3: int, float,...
        :returns: arg1/arg2 +arg3
        :rtype: int, float

        :Example:

        >>> import template
        >>> a = template.MainClass1()
        >>> a.function1(1,1,1)
        2

            important feature
        .. seealso:: :class:`MainClass2`
        .. warning:: arg2 must be non-zero.
        .. todo:: check that arg2 is non zero.
