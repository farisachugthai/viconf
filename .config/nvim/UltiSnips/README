Notes on Ultisnips
==================


=======================

And now this file contains my UltiSnips notes. It was really overwhelming
my python snippets file so I figured why not consolidate them here?

At the end of the line

snippet triggerword <description> <options>

we have a few options to choose from. Here they are.

s   Remove whitespace immediately before the cursor at the end of a line
    before jumping to the next tabstop.  This is useful if there is a
    tabstop with optional text at the end of a line.

t   Do not expand tabs - If a snippet definition includes leading tab
    characters, by default UltiSnips expands the tab characters honoring
    the Vim 'shiftwidth', 'softtabstop', 'expandtab' and 'tabstop'
    indentation settings. (For example, if 'expandtab' is set, the tab is
    replaced with spaces.) If this option is set, UltiSnips will ignore the
    Vim settings and insert the tab characters as is. This option is useful
    for snippets involved with tab delimited formats.

Important tip!:
    Write a good description because when there's more than one snippet
    to pick from the only help you'll get in picking is what you write
    for the description. so make it clear what the difference between
    snippets argprse and argprser are in the description!

Btw are the expressions ${var:str} interpreted as... if var: return var else: return str?:
    Tmk yes.

Yo the subsection snippet is awesome

Configuration
---------------------------------------------------

After configuring UltiSnipsDirs and UltiSnipsDirectories as you would like,
using the UltiSnipsEdit command should open the folder that your snippets
are housed in.

Oct 06, 2018::
On termux it opens a directory named UltiSnips and adds a file even when I was inside my UltiSnips dir!

Usage
-----

Memorizing your snippet's names is awful so make sure you have fzf.vim installed
and run Snippets to see all snippets configured for the filetype.

Now let's look at a snippet.

snippet imp "import statement" b
	import ${0:module}
endsnippet

That b at the end is an option that means 'must be at the beginning of line'

Standing On The Shoulders of Giants
===================================

The snippets have been collected from various other project which I want to
express my gratitude for. My main source for inspiration where the following
two projects:

   TextMate: http://svn.textmate.org/trunk/Bundles/
   SnipMate: http://code.google.com/p/snipmate/

UltiSnips has seen contributions by many individuals. Those contributions have
been merged into this collection seamlessly and without further comments.
